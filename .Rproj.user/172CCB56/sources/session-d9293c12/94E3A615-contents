title: "Hello!"

I am a data scientist, small business owner, and lifelong learner. 
My consultancy, [Redgranite Group](about.qmd), develops data products and insights for small-to-medium sized businesses.
I work well in interdisciplinary teams, previous colleagues include: psychologists, computer scientists, music theorists, genomicists, software engineers, and educators. 
I have strong opinions about R, Bayesian statistics, jazz, and GTD.

## Actively Looking for Longer-Term Work
I spent the last year working on freelance/consultancy projects (during move from Europe to USA) and Iâ€™m now looking for more stable, longer-term work (e.g. full-time, long-contract). 

If you're looking to hire someone with a strong foundation in the bread-and-butter data workflow (wrangling, visualising, modelling, communicating), [get in touch](mailto:director@redgranite.group)!
