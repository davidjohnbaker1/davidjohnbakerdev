    "text": "Below is a running list of (what I think are) interesting visualizations I’ve made recently. I’ve added a small caption to each to give a bit of context.\n\n\n\nVisualizations of simulated data I created to help explain revenue retention plots and layer cake plots as part of Bolero functionality. Check out Bolero’s LinkedIn for all the posts. This will also be used as a instructional webinar as part of Bolero’s promotional materials.\n\n\n\n\n\nIRS Tax data showing historical trends of individual organizations. Wrote R code that uses ProPublica’s Non-Profit Explorer API to scrape historical data, transform it to set of tidy tables, then use ggplot2 to generate colorblind friendly pallette of line graphs. I use these graphics as part of demo calls for Bolero to show each organization that I am selling to that program revenue form tickets is almost always more smooth than their donation data. This demonstrates ticket revenue is something that is much more predictable, reliable and worht understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtracted amplitude envelope of soundwave for live performance of Ravel’s Bolero to use in marketing materials for Bolero Dashboard. Scraped YouTube audio then smoothed ~16 minuetes of audio/samples to generate aesthetically pleasing and domain relevant backdrop for pitch deck and marketing mateirals.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Revenue Divisi page of Bolero Dashboard showing YoY Revenue changes for new and returning customers. Custon dashboard written as Shiny App allows users to upload ticketing data to platform and have complex, data-intensive workflows automated within seconds as Micro-SaaS. See www.bolerodashboard.com for product. offering.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimation showing growth of non-profit performing arts groups in select regions of USA over time. Client requested specific keywords to find in organization’s name for marketing leads. Same dataset also had information on year of formation, so created plot showing number of organizations (non-sensitive regions shown).\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal group of start-up founders found click-bait style article saying Maine was not growing as quickly as other states, so downloaded regularly updated goverment data to show them this KPI has too high of variability to take seriously o quarter-to-quarter basis\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of total avalible market share for Bolero Dashboard generatd by plotting all revenue from programming and contributions on log scale across select target keywords. Used in pitch deck for on-going funding to support product\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapsed version of above chart to show how higher revenue organizations can skew average results. Generated for specialist audience to communicate specific point of confusion on why averages appeared so high in some categories and why important to consider large numbers on log scale for visualizing."

    "text": "I’m a small business owner, musician, and scientist with a PhD in the humanities. Right now most of my time is spent as founder of Bolero. It’s a bootstrapped B2B SaaS that started generating revenue within six months of launching it. I’m very proud of it.\nMy consultancy, Redgranite Group, develops data products and insights for small-to-medium sized businesses. I work well in interdisciplinary teams. Previous colleagues have includde: psychologists, computer scientists, music theorists, genomicists, software engineers, and educators. I have strong opinions about R, Bayesian statistics, about the word jazz, and GTD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Currently Looking for Longer-Term Work (In a serious way)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter transitioning out of my career in academia, I spent many months applying for full-time data science and analyst roles. During that time, I started working on Bolero as an interesting portfolio project (i.e. an excuse to get better at R Shiny, R development, Quarto/Typst) that I thought might help me land a job.\nThe job market was so bad in 2025 that had enough time to essentially build an entire micro-SaaS that is now generating revenue, despite having only landed a single data science interview that year.\nI am open to full-time, remote friendly roles and consultancy that offer a competitive salary. If you’re looking to hire someone with a strong foundation in the bread-and-butter data workflow (wrangling, visualizing, modelling, communicating) who has a strong business acumen, please get in touch!\n\n\n\nLinks\n\nRedgranite Group\nBolero\nLinkedIn\nGithub\nScholar\nPersonal Blog\nBluesky\n\nBackground\n\n2026-Now: Founder, Bolero\n2024-2025 : Data Scientist, Director of Redgranite Group\n2022-2024: Postdoc at the Music Cognition Group at the University of Amsterdam\n2021-2022: Postdoc in the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths\n2020-2021: Senior Research Associate in the Computing Department at Goldsmiths\n2019-2020: Lead Instructor of Data Science at Flatiron School in London, England\n2015-2019: PhD student at Louisiana State University; Thesis\n2014-2015: Research Assistant on an AHRC funded project.\n2013-2014: MSc student in the Music, Mind and Brain programme at Goldsmiths\n2012-2013: Musician and bartender for weddings at a WWII themed restaurant\n2008-2012: Music student at Baldwin Wallace Conservatory of Music\nI grew up in Wisconsin.\n\nRecent\n\nRecent appearance on The Gateway podcast talking about parallels between music learning and data science careers\nHow Building a MicroSaas in R might make you a better data scientist @ Northeast Tableau User Group\nCharacterizing musicality and individual differences within and across societies using engaging games: A Case Study Using the Matching Pairs Paradigm @ Goldsmiths University of London\nMusical Memory Experiments for Everyone (including Experts!) @ University of Cambridge"
